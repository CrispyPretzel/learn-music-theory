- Scales (Key)
    - whole steps and half steps
    - distance between notes "b" and "c" and "e" and "f" are half step no note in between
    - formula for a scale(key)
    	(EACH NUMBER IS THE AMOUNT OF HALF NOTES)
	(AFTER EACH ROOT NOTE)
	(Example C major: C then use the formula D E F G A B then C
	- Major: 2 2 1 2 2 2 1
	- Minor: 2 1 2 2 1 2 2
	- Harmonic Minor: 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 
    - Black keys have 2 names
	- depends which note it's in between
	- if black key == left of white note = (white note) flat
	- if black key == right of white note = (white note) sharp

- Chords
    - three notes minimum
    - Short-hand explanation: starting note then every other note but in the key
      of what you chose
    - Major/Minor
	- two notes are called intervals
	- first interval determines whether chord is major or minor
	- each interval has a name
	- major 3rd = 4 half steps from root
	- minor 3rd = 3 half steps from root
	- the third note will depend on first interval: major is 3 half steps from the middle note
	  minor is 4 half steps from the middle note	
	- In other words chords are made of a root note a third and a fifth
	  but it has to be in key
	- The chord patterns: I(1) ii(2) iii(3) IV(4) V(5) vi(6) vii*(7(diminished)) where the Roman numeral is capitalized it's major 
	  the Roman numeral is lowercase it's a minor
	- I ii IV V vi are common chords in conversion pop harmony
	- Example: play in C major with a chord progression of I-V-vi-IV (or IV-V-vi-I)
		This means only play the notes in the key of C major then play the chords in that key that is asked
    - Inversions
	- move the 5th to the bottom
	- you can also move the 3rd and put it on the bottom
	- you can rearrange it in any order?
	- to make chord progression more advance use inversions to connect chords
	    - that is chords share a note
	    - notes are closer together = better transition
    - Major 7th chord
	- seventh note of the scale
	- distance between the root note and the last note of a scale is a 7th
    - Chords can continue on to 9th and 11th
    - Some chords resolve into others easily
	- V and vi have resolve into the I 
    -Basic composition of a song
	- Chords
	- Bass: the root note of the chord
	- Melody: any note in the scale but the keys in the chord is a safe bet
	- Drums	

- Rhythm
    - Tempo: beats per minute
	- Metronome: higher pitch click is the down beat
    - Time signature?
    - Time signature of 4/4 bars are made of 4 beats
    - A basic rhythm with drums:
	- high hat on 1/8 (two high hat hits per beat)
	- kick on the down beat (beats 1 and 3)
	- snare on beats 2 and 4
    - Subdivide the beats
	- Each beat can be cut in half
	- then it can be cut in half again and again
	- it's all fractions 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 and so on
    - Melodies can be subdivided as well
	- Creating steady note on top of the down beat (strong beat)
	- Can move the steady beat to the offbeat as well to create a different feel
    - Chord Progressions
	- 1 bar is not long enough for a chord progression
	- 2 bars is too short its odd
	- 3 bars is not even
	- 4 bars is nice and even
	- Can also subdivide each chord just like drums and melodies
	- Use spaces to create "bounce"
	- Use note length and rate of the note to create different feels in the music
     - Triplets:
	- Combined with 1/8 notes and/or stutters

- Ear Training
    - Being able to recognize a note in different octaves
    - Recognize minor 2nds or perfect 5th
	- It helps with identifying the scale
    - Octaves sound like Over the Rainbow
    - Perfect 5th sounds like Star Wars
    - Minor 2nds sound like Jaws
    - Listen for the chord progression
